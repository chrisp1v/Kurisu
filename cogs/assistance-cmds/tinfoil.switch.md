# We don't recommend the usage of tinfoil for the following reason:
- It installs itself to the home menu (instant ban if you connect to nintendo servers).
- It is closed source.
- It is a piracy tool.

If you're looking to dump & install your games, [follow our guide](https://suchmememanyskill.github.io/guides/switchdumpguide/) instead.
