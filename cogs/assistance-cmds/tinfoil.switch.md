**We don't recommend the usage of tinfoil for the following reasons:**
- It installs itself to the home menu (instant ban if you connect to Nintendo servers).
- It is closed source.
- It is a piracy tool.

If you're looking to dump & install your games, [follow our guide](https://suchmememanyskill.github.io/guides/switchdumpguide/) instead.
